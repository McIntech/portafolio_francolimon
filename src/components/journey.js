          Since I started my journey as a freelance programmer almost 3 years ago, I
          have learned Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Databases, Git, GitHub, C#, among
          others, and have collaborated with talented people to create digital
          products for commercial and consumer use. I am naturally curious and
          constantly work to improve my skills day by day. I would love to continue
          learning and participate with new work teams.
